Core Java - Introduction Assignment
Instructions:
Below you will find a series of assignments that you will complete in this exercise. You will need to create a new
project folder for this task and name it Java_Assignment_1_Introduction. You can use the default settings when
creating the new project.
For each of the below assignments you will create a new class as specified below and write your code in a main()
method of that class. You can use the same (default) package when creating each class.
Assignments
1. Write a class named Assignment1 in which you print the message “Hello, World!” to the console
2. Write a class named Assignment2 in which you declare a variable, x. In the next line, set the value of x to
5. Print the value of x to the console.
3. Write a class named Assignment3 in which you declare the variables, x and y. Set the value of x to 15 and
set the value of y to 10. Create a third variable, z and assign the result of the sum of x and y to z. Print the
value of z to the console.
4. Write a class named Assignment4 in which you declare an array of 5 numbers. Print its length to the
console. (Use the .length property)
5. Write a class named Assignment5 in which you declare an array of ten strings. Print the 2nd element.
(Remember that arrays indexes start at 0, not 1).
6. Write a class named Assignment6 that declares an array of two numbers (10.5 and 11.5). Add the two
numbers together and print the result.
7. Write a class named Assignment7 that declares an array of three numbers (11, 22, 33). Subtract the first
two and add the third; (11- 22 + 33). Print the result.
8. Write a class named Assignment8, that declares two floats (105.678 and 222.4871). Multiply them and print
the result.
9. Write a class named Assignment9 that declares a boolean variable on. Set its value to true. Print the result.
10. Write a class named Assignment10 that declares an array of five strings. Print the 5th element.
Goal:
The purpose of this assignment is to provide you practice with writing simple classes. You will utilize the main()
method of your classes to execute a particular goal of the assignment. You will also gain experience writing print
messages to the console as well as performing simple arithmetic operations and using arrays.
By the end of this assignment, you will have 1 new project folder with 10 classes that meet the requirements
mentioned above.
Helpful Notes
Project Structure:
• Your project structure should resemble the above. Note that the name of the project is
Java_Assignment_1_Introduction and all class files are named according to the associated assigned
number
Assignment Classes:
• Notice the indentation of the statement on line 5 to show that it is part of the main() method. Likewise, your
code should follow this pattern.
